## 🔍 What is the IVT-3WLA?

The **Temporal Variability Index for the 3-Week Lookahead (IVT-3WLA)** is a three-dimensional model designed to evaluate the **stability and credibility** of weekly planning in construction, mining, EPC/EPCM, and industrial projects.

The model integrates:

- **ACF — Amplitude of Change**
- **FC — Frequency of Change**
- **CVF — Coefficient of Variation (Accumulated)**

Together, these metrics uncover hidden variability patterns that traditional 3WLA reports cannot detect.

- Standardize the evaluation of 3WLA temporal stability  
- Identify hidden variability patterns in weekly planning  
- Offer templates for practical adoption  
- Share real examples of ACF, FC, and CVF evolution  
- Enable contributions from the global community  
- Build a dataset of 3WLA historical records for benchmarking and research
